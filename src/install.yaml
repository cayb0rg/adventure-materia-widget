  generation_prompt: A node can have the following types - "mc", "shortanswer", "hotspot", "end", "narrative", or "blank" - but nodes cannot come after an end node. This is stored in the "type" field of the node's options. Every node must have a 'nodeId' attribute. Also, make sure that answer's 'link' attributes point to existing nodes with the corresponding nodeId. If a there does not exist a node with the corresponding nodeId, create a new node with that nodeId branched off the current node. Finally, make sure to include the 'options' attribute in the top level of the JSON with the correct 'nodeCount', etc.
