# Overview #

Choose Your Own Adventure is a powerful widget that allows for the creation of branching decision trees. Students are scored based on where they end up.

## Details ##

Each destination, or point on the decision tree, is represented by a screen such as the one above. A question or narrative text, accompanied by an optional image, provides the context for your response. Some screens will provide multiple choice answers to choose from; others may provide an input box in which to enter a response. Other screens may not require an answer, and simply provide transitional text or information to advance the widget's narrative.

### Hotspot Screen ###

The hotspot screen is the one significant exception to the Adventure widget's layout. Hover your cursor over the image to identify and select a hotspot, based on the (optional) instructions provided. The proceeding destination may depend upon the hotspot you select.

### Your Choices Determine Your Score ###

In Choose Your Own Adventure, the score you receive is based on the final screen you encounter. Your responses to various questions determine the route you take; some widgets may be more linear than others. Additionally, you may or may not encounter screens of every type (Multiple Choice, Short Answer, Hotspot, and Narrative).
